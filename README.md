# 🎤 Offensive Lyrics Classification Using Machine Learning & NLP

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify whether song lyrics contain offensive or toxic language. Using a dataset with over **900,000 records**, the project explores text preprocessing, feature extraction, and predictive modeling to identify harmful or offensive content in music lyrics.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with large datasets, perform text analysis, and build interpretable machine learning models.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze a large dataset of music lyrics  
- Clean and preprocess text data  
- Extract meaningful features from the lyrics  
- Build a machine learning model to classify offensive language  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix  

The model focuses on **logistic regression**, a simple and interpretable baseline for text classification.
